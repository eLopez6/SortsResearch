# SortsResearch
My final project submission for EECS 233 Data Structures at Case Western. Implements MergeSort, QuickSort, and HeapSort and compares their runtimes on arrays of varying size and randomness.

When ran, Reporting2.java needs an input text file, formatted as individual numbers separated by newlines. The path of this correctly formatted text file is the sole input argument to the command line execution of the Reporting2. Reporting1 has no command line arguments.
